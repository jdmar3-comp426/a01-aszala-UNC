					Because it was widely available, yellow ochre pigment was one of the first colors used in art;
					the Lascaux cave in France has a painting of a yellow horse 17,000 years old. Ochre and orpiment
					pigments were used to represent gold and skin color in Egyptian tombs, then in the murals in Roman villas.
					In the early Christian church, yellow was the color associated with the Pope and the golden keys of
					the Kingdom, but it was also associated with Judas Iscariot and used to mark heretics. In the 20th
					century, Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear a yellow star. In China, bright yellow was
					the color of the Middle Kingdom, and could be worn only by the emperor and his household; special guests
					were welcomed on a yellow carpet Click <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">here</a> for a cool video.
