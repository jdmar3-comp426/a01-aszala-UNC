				<div class="color-information">
					During post-classical and early modern Europe, green was the color commonly associated with wealth, merchants,
					bankers and the gentry, while red was reserved for the nobility. For this reason, the costume of the Mona Lisa
					by Leonardo da Vinci and the benches in the British House of Commons are green while those in the House of Lords
					are red. It also has a long historical tradition as the color of Ireland and of Gaelic culture. It is the historic
					color of Islam, representing the lush vegetation of Paradise. It was the color of the banner of Muhammad, and is
					found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries. Click <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">here</a> for a cool video.
